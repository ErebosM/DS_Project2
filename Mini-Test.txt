a) Socket class, ?? class
b) Blocking" means that the caller waits until the callee finishes its processing.
   For instance, a "blocking read" from a socket waits until there is data to return;
   a "non-blocking" read does not, it just returns an indication (usually a count) of
   whether there was something read.
   In the case of InputStream the .read() feature call blocks while it waits for data,
   all the others (for example available())
   don't.
   OutputStream, however, does never block.
